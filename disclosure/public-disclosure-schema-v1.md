# Public Disclosure Schema v1.0

This document defines the **mandatory disclosure schema** for any
AI-generated, skill-derived, or benchmarked output released to the public
under NGTH and PAPP systems.

Public disclosure is a governance function, not a presentation layer.

---

## Disclosure Principle

All public disclosures MUST be:

- Truthful and non-deceptive
- Contextualized and non-exaggerated
- Attributable and auditable
- Comparable across time and jurisdiction

Outputs that cannot meet these criteria MUST NOT be publicly disclosed.

---

## Disclosure Scope

This schema applies to:

- Skill outputs released to the public
- KPI dashboards and reports
- Benchmark results
- Agent-assisted summaries or explanations
- Public-facing AI interpretations

---

Each public disclosure MUST include the following sections.

---

### 1. Statement of Observation
