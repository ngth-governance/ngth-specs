# KPI Schema v1.0

This document defines the **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) schema**
used by NGTH and PAPP for public governance observation.

Within NGTH, KPIs are instruments of **transparency and comparability**,
not proof of policy success or political performance.

---

## KPI Design Principle

All KPIs under NGTH MUST be:

- Observable rather than normative
- Comparable across time and jurisdiction
- Methodologically stable
- Resistant to political framing
- Compatible with public disclosure requirements

KPIs MUST NOT be used as standalone evidence of policy success or failure.

---

## KPI Scope

This schema applies to:

- Publicly disclosed governance indicators
- KPI dashboards and time-series reports
- Benchmark-linked indicators
- AI-assisted KPI interpretation summaries

---

## KPI Classification

All KPIs MUST be classified into one of the following categories.

---

### 1. Service Capacity Indicators

**Purpose:**  
Describe system capacity and availability.

**Examples:**
- Number of service units available
- Staffing levels
- Facility operating hours
- System throughput limits

**Notes:**  
Capacity does not imply adequacy or quality.

---

### 2. Access and Utilization Indicators

**Purpose:**  
Describe how services are accessed and used.

**Examples:**
- Wait times
- Utilization rates
- Geographic coverage
- Access frequency

**Notes:**  
High utilization may indicate demand pressure, not success.

---

### 3. Timeliness Indicators

**Purpose:**  
Describe responsiveness over time.

**Examples:**
- Median response time
- Processing delays
- Escalation timelines

---

### 4. Continuity and Stability Indicators

**Purpose:**  
Describe system consistency and reliability.

**Examples:**
- Service interruption rates
- Staff turnover
- Infrastructure downtime

---

### 5. Outcome-Adjacent Indicators

**Purpose:**  
Describe observable results without causal claims.

**Examples:**
- Completion rates
- Follow-up occurrence
- Post-service contact frequency

**Restrictions:**  
Outcome-adjacent indicators MUST NOT assert causality.

---

## Prohibited KPI Categories

The following MUST NOT be classified or disclosed as KPIs:

- Political promises or targets
- Forecasted future outcomes
- Individual-level predictions
- Attributions of intent or blame
- Cost-benefit claims without full methodological disclosure

---

## KPI Metadata Requirements

Each KPI MUST include:

- Clear definition
- Measurement method
- Data source(s)
- Update frequency
- Known limitations
- Applicable jurisdiction and domain

---

## KPI and Benchmark Relationship

KPIs MAY be used as inputs to benchmark evaluation.

Benchmarks evaluate **skill suitability**, not KPI desirability.

KPI performance MUST NOT override benchmark failure.

---

## KPI Disclosure Constraints

All publicly disclosed KPIs MUST comply with:

- Public Disclosure Schema v1.0
- Skill Benchmark Rubric v1.0 (where applicable)

---

## Normative Status

This document is normative.

All KPIs disclosed under NGTH systems MUST comply with this schema.
